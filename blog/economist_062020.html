          <h3><i>The genius of Amazon</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The pandemic has fuelled a digital surge that shows how important
              Amazon is to ordinary life in America and Europe,
              because of its crucial role in e-commerce, logistics and cloud
              computing.
            </li>
            <li>
              The signs are that some of the boom will last after the pandemic,
              because it has involved not just the same people doing more of the
              same.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mr Bezos argues that Amazon is in a perpetual virtual circle in
              which it spends money to win market share and expands into
              adjacent industries.
            </li>
            <li>
              The world's most admired business faces problems: a fraying social
              contract, financial bloating and re-energized competition.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>The new world disorder</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The international system, with the UN at its apex, is beset by
              internal problems, by the global struggle to cope with the rise
              of China, and most of all by the neglect of the United States.
            </li>
            <li>
              The UN is bureaucratic and infuriating, but it does the essential
              job to prevent countries from drifting into antagonism themselves.
            </li>
            <li>
              The US-China antagonism and America's continued careless
              treatment of multilateral institutions make it hard to protect
              the system from the forces of disorder.
            </li>
            <li>
              The middling powers, like Japan and Germany, and the rising ones
              like India and Indonesia, need to step forward to make the world
              safe.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Not Britain's finest hour</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The British government's tardiness is evidenced by its delay in
              shutting down in March.
              It played a bad hand badly, causing the highest death rate of any
              country in the rich world.
            </li>
            <li>
              In retrospect, the government should have probed the scientists'
              advice more deeply, which has turned out to be the wrong approach.
            </li>
            <li>
              Delays in fixing PPE supply chains, promoting face coverings and
              increasing testing capacity were clearly errors at the time.
            </li>
            <li>
              When the systems break it is the government's job to mend them;
              when the evidence argues for drastic measures ministers need to
              take them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ministers were chosen on ideological grounds and are not
              competent for cooping with a pandemic.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>The next catastrophe</i></h3> 
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Individuals and governments alike have a preference to ignore
              low-probability, high-impact events, such as asteroid strikes,
              pandemics and corona mast ejections (CME), until forced to react.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is governments' responsibility to keep an eye on the future
              and put together plans for society at large.
            </li>
            <li>
              Early-warning systems and thought-through preparedness are
              possible to reduce risks of all sorts of catastrophic events,
              such as pandemics, climate changes and nuclear wars.
            </li>
            <li>
              Scanning the future for risks and taking proper note of what
              you see is a mark of prudent maturity.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
