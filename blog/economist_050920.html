          <h3><i>A dangerous gap</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Even with all the dramatic precedents in stock-market history,
              the past eight weeks still have been remarkable.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The S&amp;P 500 lost a third of its value in a month right
                  before it rocketed and recovered half of the loss.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The rosy view from Wall Street contrasts life on Main Street,
              where unemployment is still savage.
            </li>
            <li>
              The optimistic mood is because of the Fed, who has relentless
              bought up corporate bonds to avoid a deeper recession.
            </li>
            <li>
              The market was lopsided to a handful of businesses even before the
              pandemic, and it has become even more so.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are countless threats to the sanguine prospect.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  There is the risk of an aftershock, such as a second wave
                  of infections or a steep recession.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The market's confidence is vulnerable to fraud scandals
                  bred over the years of the expansion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The increasing gap between smaller firms and bigger corporations
                  may lead to a political backlash.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              A one-month bear market scarcely seems enough time to absorb all
              the possible bad news from the pandemic and the huge uncertainty
              it has created.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>The food miracle</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The food miracle reflects a $8trn global supply chain,
              which is an unsung star of 21st-century logistics.
            </li>
            <li>
              Concentration and government intervention, along with the vagaries
              of the climate and commodity markets, have resulted devastating
              consequences in history (2007-08).
            </li>
            <li>
              The global food system has so far passed the server test,
              with each of its layer adapted.
            </li>
            <li>
              The ever-present risk is that rising poverty or production glitches
              will lead panicky politicians to stockpile food and limit exports.
            </li>
            <li>
              Governments need to hold their nerve and keep the world's food
              system open for business.
            </li>
            <li>
              The food security relies on interdependence and diversity,
              rather than self-sufficiency drives and blunt intervention.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>The pandemic is a turning point in history</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The covid-19 is a pivotal that challenges the old order,
              forcing questions about what sort of future we want, what the
              proper role of government is and what makes a healthy society.
            </li>
            <li>
              Long before covid-19, there were warnings about deep social
              inequalities and the shortcomings of globalization.
            </li>
            <li>
              As history shows, those societies that survive and adapt best
              to catastrophes are already strong.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Some countries controlled the pandemic more effectively
                  because people have faith in the authorities and each other.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Much also depends on leaders.
              Wise leaders in the past have been able to steer away from danger.
            </li>
            <li>
              The present crisis could be the opportunity for strategies to
              produce essential public goods and ensure that citizens have
              safe, decent and fulfilled lives.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Parallel universe</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Through aggressive use of economic sanctions, America is misusing
              its clout as the predominant financial power, thereby pushing allies
              and foes alike towards building a separate financial architecture.
            </li>
            <li>
              America's pull within the system remains huge, and the world's
              financial plumbing remains under its thumb.
            </li>
            <li>
              Three things are driving the change.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  America has started to cripple rivals by denying them access
                  to the world's liquidity supply, which creates a strong
                  incentive for others to seek workarounds.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Many emerging markets, not only China, are keen on a rebalance
                  to meet their financial needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The covid-19 further fragments global trade and could dent
                  confidence on America's ability to guarantee global prosperity.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
