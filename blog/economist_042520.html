          <h3><i>After the disease, the debt</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Public borrowing in the rich world is set to soar to levels last
              seen amid the rubble and smoke of 1945 and will carry long-lasting
              consequences.
            </li>
            <li>
              High as the national debt is, the cost of servicing it may not be
              demanding as long as interest rates are low.
            </li>
            <li>
              Governments have to walk a treacherous path between stimulus
              today and prudence tomorrow.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Inadequate fiscal support today risks pushing the economy
                  into a spiral of decline.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Wild borrowing for years would eventually threaten trouble,
                  especially for rich countries other than America.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Once the virus abates, a burst of demand may boost interest
                  rates even though they are comfortably low today.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The politics of deficit reduction will be toxic,
                  especially when the pandemic calls for lavish spending.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the throes of the pandemic, the withdrawal of emergency
                  support would be self-defeating.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Modestly higher inflation would help ease debt burdens and
              meanwhile make up the shortfall of the targets.
            </li>
            <li>
              Governments should raise taxes on land, inheritance, carbon
              emissions and, in America, consumption.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          
          <h3><i>Undercut</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Governments may wish to pay off debt with taxation.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  One likely constraint is politics in that quite a few people
                  would be upset for raising taxes or cutting spendings.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Such austerity seems to be scant and emotional.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Governments could default or restructure debts.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A modern economy integrated into global financial markets has
                  a huge problem if capital markets lock it out.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Promises to increase health-care and pension spending in coming
                  decades are easier to renege on.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Governments can wait it out, rolling over their debts while hoping
              they shrink relative to the economy over time.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The secret is to ensure that the economy's combined level of
                  real economical growth and inflation stays handily above the
                  interest rate the government pays on its debt.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Stopping interest rates from following inflation upwards
                  was achieved by means of a regulatory system, which deprives
                  citizens of better investment options and thus forces them
                   to lend to governments at low interest rates.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>A pandemic of power grabs</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Many governments have enacted emergency laws vesting extra powers
              in the executive to cope with covid-19,
              but some of them are not necessary and won't be relinquished
              after the pandemic.
            </li>
            <li>
              Autocrats are delighted to have respectable excuses to ban
              mass protests, postpone elections, selectively enforce
              lockdown rules, invade individual privacy, and ban "fake news".
            </li>
            <li>
              Journalists and human-rights activists are not able to venture out,
              leaving power grabbers unchecked.
            </li>
            <li>
              Many of the liberty-constricting actions taken by regimes are
              more detrimental to public health.
            </li>
            <li>
              Autocrats' inability to deal with popular suffering will eventually
              cause their regimes to lose control.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Pimp the ride</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Investors were pessimistic about he car industry even before the
              recession for their to-be-obsolete technologies and collapsing sales.
            </li>
            <li>
              Car firms are burning cash on their high fixed costs,
              and may also suffer from defaults on car loans and a permanent
              fall in commuting.
            </li>
            <li>
              Millions of jobs would be at risk if the car industry was destructed.
              But there is also a risk that government aid ossifies car firms
              before they have modernized.
            </li>
            <li>
              The industry should take control of its own fate by:
              <ul>
                <li>adapting to new health protocols,</li>
                <li>keeping up investments on new technologies, and</li>
                <li>joining forces (consolidation).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Tear down this wall</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Microsoft, a byword for technical walled garden two decades ago,
              recently joined a fledgling movement to liberate the world's data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Many governments have recognized the potential of data sharing,
              but companies were concerned about intellectual property,
              users' privacy and technical hurdles.
            </li>
            <li>
              Microsoft's campaign is the most consequential by far,
              and could be compared as IBM's embracement of Linux in the late 1990s.
            </li>
            <li>
              Brad Smith believes that more sharing would counteract the
              concentration of economic and political power, but won't be easy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Microsoft could benefit by championing open data by virtue of its
              business model.
              Unfortunately, that is not the case for many other data-rich firms.
            </li>
