          This post is what I learned from the recent issue of <i>The Economist</i>
          and DOES NOT represent my personal stand.

          <h3><i>The 90% economy</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              An 90% economy is miserable as shown in China,
              and probably also presage a hard life in the post-lockdown rich
              world.
            </li>
            <li>
              Economies will be held back even if restrictions are sensibly
              eased.
              <ul>
                <li>Leaving lockdown is a process, not an event.</li>
                <li>The uncertainty will inhibit those who fear the disease.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Many business will emerge from lockdown short of money,
              which will further deepen people's financial worries.
            </li>
            <li>
              A deep, long recession will stoke anger and summon popular
              demand for political changes, either constructive or bleak.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Unsteady states</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The pandemic is a budgetary cataclysm to American's states,
              counties and cities, whose rainy-day funds are insufficient and
              unevenly distributed.
              Infusions from the federal government are therefore the only way
              to avoid ill-timed austerity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Help from Congress has so far been lacking, for the reason that
              it would be costly to create the impression that Congress will,
              in a downturn, bail out profligate states and cities.
            </li>
            <li>
              The pandemic is a natural disaster in which Americans should
              share risk as in the past.
              Besides, making up tax shortfalls during lockdowns would
              benefit all states.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Fed's loans are both inadequate due to restrictions on
              borrowing, and undesirable for the political risks and
              moral hazard it may introduce.
              Thus, better for Congress to stump up.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>West-coast shuffle</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Tech firms are thriving amid a savage recession,
              compared with more traditional big firms that are enduring
              the pain.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hints of vulnerability are shown in advertising revenue,
              smartphone sales and services relying on human contact.
            </li>
            <li>
              New sources of growth are becoming clearer, potentially shifting
              tech's spiritual center of gravity from San Francisco to Seattle.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Open schools first</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Shutting schools and keeping children at home is imposing
              heavy costs on children's development, on their parents and on
              the economy.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Real-life teachers and the social skills acquired in the
                  playground are irreplaceable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Without schools helping level the playing field,
                  the achievement gap between affluent and working-class
                  children will grow.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Parents who work at home are less productive if distracted by
                  young children, and mothers having to carry out child care may
                  lose ground in the workplace.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Children are not as likely to catch or die from the disease as adults,
              and there's no evidence that they could be silent spreaders who
              pass it on to their families.
            </li>
            <li>
              Schools should re-open in stages, starting from youngest children
              and then those facing exams.
            </li>
            <li>
              Making school attendance voluntary may entrench educational
              inequality.
              Instead, governments should insist that education is compulsory,
              but don't fine frightened parents willy-nilly.
            </li>
          </ul>
