          <h3><i>The exception</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              As the rupture between China and America in tech industry
              continues to grow,
              the pattern in high finance, however, is of superpower engagement,
              not estrangement.
            </li>
            <li>
              Although western, and in particular American, capital markets
              still reign supreme on most measures, Wall Street's taste for
              China reflects a long-term bet that finance's center of gravity
              will shift east.
            </li>
            <li>
              The rush of Wall Street firms and other foreign investors into
              China has potentially great economic interests but also some
              political risks.
            </li>
            <li>
              The trade war has shown the clout of China's capital markets, and
              has also given the control-obsessed officials an incentive to
              loosen their grip further.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Office politics</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              People have drawn radically different conclusions on the future
              of the office, with both optimism and worries.
            </li>
            <li>
              Built since the age of steam power, the system of central offices
              always had glaring shortcomings, some of which have become worse
              over time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Before covid-19, the inertia allowed the office to escape serious
              disruption of the technologies of the recent decades.
            </li>
            <li>
              Since the pandemic, a powerful network effect has happened on
              remote-working technologies, and bureaucratic hurdles to remote
              work have been blasted out of the way.
            </li>
            <li>
              Optional offices might be the new norm when a vaccine arrives,
              but the exact balance will depend on the industry and city.
            </li>
            <li>
              Companies will have to adapt to the pattern of sporadic attendance
              with more targeted staff interactions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Governments had better to embrace the consequences of the
              technological change by modernizing employment law and
              redeveloping city centers.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Power in the 21st century</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              As the public governments and investors wake up to climate change,
              the clean-energy industry is gaining momentum.
            </li>
            <li>
              Compared with fossil fuels, the emerging new energy system will
              not only be better to the environment and human health,
              but should also be more politically stable and less economically
              volatile.
            </li>
            <li>
              Two risks stand out:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Autocratic China could temporarily gain clout over the global
                  power system.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Petrostates will face a vicious fight for market share,
                  without enough public resources for economic and political
                  reform.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>
                The world's move to a new energy order is vital,
                but it will be messy.
              </li>
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Why governments get it wrong</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The increase in diagnosed cases reflects not only the gloomy
              reality but also extra testing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Treatments and medicines have brought down the fatalities,
              and more progress is in store.
            </li>
            <li>
              The pandemic will remain a part of daily life well into 2021.
            </li>
            <li>
              Governments need to identify a reasonable trade-off between
              shutting down to keep people alive and staying open so that life
              goes on.
            </li>
            <li>
              Governments like America, Britain, Israel and Spain persist in
              getting it disastrously wrong.
            </li>
          </ul>
