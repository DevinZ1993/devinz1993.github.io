          <h3><i>Seize the moment</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The two global calamities, the pandemic and the climate crisis,
              not only resemble each other, but also interact: 
              shutting down has introduced an 8% drop in greenhouse-gas emissions.
            </li>
            <li>
              The pandemic has revealed the grim size of the climate challenge,
              but also creates a unique chance to enact government
              policies that steer the economy away from carbon at a lower
              financial, social and political cost.
            </li>
            <li>
              With the cost of clean energies having tumbled in the past decade,
              it is a propitious time to push carbon pricing and incentivize
              the shift.
            </li>
            <li>
              Subsidies and direct government investment are also needed to
              ensure that technologies are available for making the change.
            </li>
            <li>
              The risk of climate-damaging policies loom in some countries,
              and it is up to governments to make the covid-19 pause
              climate-friendly.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>The cure and the disease</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The widespread lockdowns were not a thought-out response,
              but a desperate measure at a desperate time.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is becoming clearly how costly lockdowns are,
              with the poorest countries and the most vulnerable groups being
              hit hardest.
            </li>
            <li>
              To limit the risk of a second wave requires an epidemiological
              approach that focuses on the places and people most likely to
              spread the disease.
            </li>
            <li>
              Extensive testing data is required for governments to refine
              their policies, both universal ones and narrow local ones.
            </li>
            <li>
              Poor countries will not be able to afford all these approaches,
              but they also have more experience of infectious diseases.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Chip wars</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              America's first-round embargo on Huawei failed to emaciate the
              Chinese firm,  but the new measures focus on a bottleneck and
              could freeze the company out completely.
            </li>
            <li>
              Markets remain sanguine about the company despite its own survival
              concerns, and hunting for ways to sidestep the sanction will
              undergo
            </li>
            <li>
              The episode may bring about China's retaliation,
              and tech firms that straddle the two countries are trying to
              keep both sides happy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using the technological clout, in the long run, could undermine
              the very American dominance that gives rise to it.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>The land down under</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Having thrown nearly everything at the covid-19 downturn,
              the Fed remains conservative about negative interest rates
              despite precedents of foreign peers and signals from the
              derivatives markets.
            </li>
            <li>
              Many policy rules suggested that rates ought to be cut deep into
              negative territory since the global financial crisis.
              Also, the risks and costs of cash hoarding at least justify
              modestly negative interest rates.
            </li>
            <li>
              Central bankers weighing further rate cuts face three important
              questions.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  More deeply negative rates could be made possible by
                  regulatory tweaks, which raise the cost of hoarding cash.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Negative rates beyond a "reversal rate" might squish banks'
                  margins and give forth to a contraction in bank lending.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Far more potent weapons,such as fiscal stimulus in combination
                  with central-bank asset purchases, have not reached their
                  economic and political limits.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
