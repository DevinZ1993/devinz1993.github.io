          <h3><i>Is China winning?</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Despite the initial bungling,
              China's severe quarantine and lockdown have worked out,
              which is hailed as a triumph by the country.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some believe China will be the winner of the covid catastrophe,
              and warn that the pandemic will be a geopolitical turning-point away from America.
            </li>
            <li>
              China may not succeed in enhancing its sway even though Trump
              has no interest in leading the global response to the virus.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  People may be leery about the authoritarian regime's claim
                  on its impressive record.
                </li>
                <li>
                  China's propaganda is often crass and unpleasant.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some countries are suspicious of China's motives,
                  and China will also be harmed by their retreat from globalization.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Most importantly, China shows no sign of intending to do so.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Two tests of China's ambitions to acquire a new role:
              <ul>
                <li>how it acts in the race for  a vaccine;</li>
                <li>whether it offers debt relief for poor countries.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Perhaps, China is less interested in running the world than in
              ensuring that other powers cannot or dare not attempt to thwart it.
              The prospect is not comforting when it comes to the global
              problems we are going to face.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Fumbling for the exit strategy</i></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ideas for exiting the covid-19 lockdown are spreading faster than
              the virus ever did.
            </li>
            <li>
              The need to devise exit plans is urgent due to the alarming cost
              of lockdown.
              Yet, they are also hard because the most of the world remains
              susceptible to a second wave of covid-19.
            </li>
            <li>
              Governments should choose from the menu of options based on their
              own cost-benefit analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
              Testing can tell governments about the running state of the
              infections and help arrest the spread of the disease,
              but it will not be available on a truly mass scale for many months.
            </li>
            <li>
              The worldwide race for a vaccine is a worthwhile investment.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3><i>Jam postponed</i></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              As most companies face a collapse in profits,
              there is a fraught debate about whether firms should
              cut their dividends.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dividends are a necessary feature of a market economy.
              <ul>
                <li>Retirement schemes honor its commitments.</li>
                <li>Young companies get funded and repair their balance-sheets.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Companies are loath to make sudden, big changes to their dividend
              payments, but the pressure to cut has come with lower profits.
            </li>
            <li>
              Systematically important firms, which receive government bail-outs,
              should repay taxpayers before rewarding investors.
            </li>
            <li>
              Banks should also cut dividends to support more lending instead.
            </li>
            <li>
              Firms that are stretched but feel that keeping up reliable
              dividends sends an important signal should think twice.
            </li>
            <li>
              The group of business that have strong balance-sheets and are
              operating at near full tilt should pay dividends rather than
              hoard cash.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3><i>Picking off the weak</i></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The economic impact of the pandemic is beyond prediction,
              but some economies will certainly suffer much more than
              others.
            </li>
            <li>
              Economic crises expose and exacerbate structural weaknesses,
              making huge gaps among countries whose growth rates converge
              during expansions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>The Economist</i> has used three indicators to rank the
              exposure of 33 rich countries to the downturn.
              <ul>
                <li>The industrial structure:
                  lockdown will slam countries that depend on labour-intensive
                  activities.
                </li>
                <li>The shape of the corporate sector:
                  economies with a large share of small firms are more likely to
                  be scarred by long shutdowns.
                </li>
                <li>The nature of fiscal support:
                  both the size and the design of the stimulus matter.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Government pledges to protect jobs may slow the recovery,
              although the coronavirus recession may be different.
            </li>
          </ul>
