          <h3><i>A grim calculus</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li> Covid-19 presents stark and diehard choices to governments.
              Leaders have to "put a dollar figure on life".
            </li>
            <li> As the pandemic ravages the world, nations are making trade-offs
              in different ways. Not all of them make sense.
            </li>
            <li> Three principles of thinking about these trade-offs:
              <ul>
                <li>be systematic (contending moral and social values); </li>
                <li>help those on the losing side (sacked workers and children);</li>
                <li>adapt to changes (in case of a gloomy future).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Bottomless Pit, Inc</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li> Governments are giving unprecedented handouts to help private firms
              live through the lockdowns, which is necessary but may be toxic to
              the economy's dynamism.
            </li>
            <li> Since the duration of lockdowns is unclear,
              private investors are reluctant to swoop in.
            </li>
            <li> Governments should offer support for business in an integrated way.
              For example, make sure banks have the resources to lend so that small
              firms are able to get cash.
            </li>
            <li> The cost of extending unlimited credit to all firms is unsustainable
              and the economy must eventually adjust to new circumstances.
            </li>
            <li> Governments should not interfere in other ways, except banning firms
              getting bespoke deals from paying cash to shareholders.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Don't waste a good crisis</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li> The pandemic is a good time for tech giants to detoxify their testy
              relations with society.
            </li>
            <li> Big tech firms have enjoyed surging demand, and have also
              exhibited outstanding financial reliability.
            </li>
            <li> Small firms are being crushed and are likely to be snapped up by
              the tech giants.
            </li>
            <li> Big tech firms are acting as vital utilities in the crisis,
              but that also justifies regulations to cap their prices and profits.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Exit unicorns, pursued by bears</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>The perpetually loss-making business models and exuberant
              valuations of unicorns are increasingly being questioned.
              "Fear of missing out" is giving way to "fear of looking stupid".
            </li>
            <li> The past decade has seen a huge amount of money flowing towards
              cash-burning firms, but the euphoria began to ebb last year.
              A notorious example is the fiasco of WeWork.
            </li>
            <li> The coronavirus shock comes at a time when most tech unicorns
              were already exhibiting underlying health problems.
            </li>
            <li> In the physical world, the flywheels (of Uber) gum up due
              to the friction of scaling costs.
            </li>
            <li> Some believe real tech companies must be those whose products
              are technologies (e.g. cloud-based corp services),
              rather than those using technologies.
              But that doesn't mean consumer Internet is dead (e.g. Airbnb
              and ByteDance).
            </li>
            <li> The overstated valuations are also led by the complex and
              opaque financial practices behind the calculation of valuations,
              like ownership structure and governance.
            </li>
            <li> Firms are finding ways out including retrenchment, consolidation
              and acquisition (selling to the big uglies).
              Whatever the results, the term "unicorn" will probably no more
              exist.
            </li>
          </ul>
