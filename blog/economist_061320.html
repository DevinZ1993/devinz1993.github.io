          This post is what I learned from the recent issue of <i>The Economist</i>
          and DOES NOT represent my personal stand.

          <h3><i>The power of protest</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The legacy of George Floyd, the rich promise of social reform,
              is too precious to waste.
            </li>
            <li>
              The protest may be accounted for by the sheer ubiquity of social
              media, the pandemic that coops people up, and a president who
              sets out to sow division, but most fundamentally it reflects
              a rising rejection of racism itself.
            </li>
            <li>
              America is not only a country, but also an idea, which wraps up a
              conviction that progress is possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              The progress is happening in three ways:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Both democratic and republican politicians are pushing forward
                  police reforms.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Federal government is making efforts to reduce racial
                  segregation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The business world has an incentive to improve diversity for
                  higher profit margins.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Protest movements have a habit of antagonizing the moderate
              supporters that large-scale social change needs to succeed.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Achilles heal</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The miserable mood of many economic forecasters is in striking
              contrast with booming stockmarkets and the increasingly bullish
              mood in many boardrooms,
              making some believe this is a clear sign of spreading irrational
              exuberance.
            </li>
            <li>
              A stream of positive corporate and economic data provides some
              grounds for optimism, both in America and around the globe.
            </li>
            <li>
              Governments' stimuli have successfully shielded firms from
              bankruptcy and protected consumers' incomes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Yet the rally is prone to both the withdrawal of stimulus and
              a second wave of pandemic.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>After disaster</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Covid-19 struck the most exciting, global cities hardest,
              with appalling death tolls and grave quietness.
              It has attacked the core of what makes large western cities
              vibrant and successful.
            </li>
            <li>
              Losing people and business may forebode a fiscal crunch of cities,
              and even a spiral of budget cuts, deteriorating services, rising
              crime and middle-class flight.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cities remain invaluable as places where people can build networks
              and learn how to collaborate,
              but they need more automony to adapt to the post-covid era.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cities are not only big contributors of national economy,
              but also where people learn to live in a modern, open society.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Reality check</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Although machine learning has recently made much progress,
              doubts have lately been creeping in about whether today's AI
              technology is really as world-changing as it seems.
            </li>
            <li>
              Just as the former two waves of AI-related excitement,
              many of the grandest claims made about AI have once again failed
              to become reality.
            </li>
            <li>
              Those hoping to make use of AI's potential must confront two sets
              of problems.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The massive data and computational power that machine learning
                  demands can be impractical.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Machine learning algorithms only excel at well-bounded tasks,
                  but can get things very wrong if faced with unexpected input.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Another full-blown AI winter is unlikely, but an autumnal breeze
              is picking up.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
