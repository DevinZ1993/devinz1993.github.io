          <h3><i>Retro or radical?</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Thanks to Mr Trump's flailing, Mr Biden finds himself in landslide
              territory without having to do much to get there,
              and could have the opportunity to do something bigger than
              what was expected.
            </li>
            <li>
              Change in America is made by the extremes, but those who frighten
              the voters cannot make lasting change through the federal
              government.
            </li>
            <li>
              Despite being viewed with suspicion on the left,
              Mr Biden's caution could open up the possibility of more change
              than a real radical would.
            </li>
            <li>
              In contrast with the past, the centrist virtues of decency,
              experience and a willingness to act on advice from competent
              people could seem more alluring in 2020.
            </li>
            <li>
              A public option in health care, greenhouse-gas reduction,
              and return to multilateral engagement in foreign policy are in
              Mr Biden's policy plans.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Techtonic plates</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The global tech industry has been enjoying a golden era despite
              the gloomy predictions due to tensions between America and
              China,
              but the events in the past two weeks signal that the split is
              about to come.
            </li>
            <li>
              The American and Chinese software and internet universes,
              which were never particularly connected, are heading at
              light-speed towards total separation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hardware is moving much more slowly, because it is more globally
              integrated and will be expensive to split.
            </li>
            <li>
              It will be surprising to see how the two technospheres of
              influence are drawn and how much the split could cost.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Trade without trust</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Huawei ban has shown that trust in the global trading
              system has collapsed and a new trade architecture is needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              The middle way between a naive embrace of Chinese state capitalism
              and a cold war has proved untenable.
            </li>
            <li>
              The true burden of ripping Huawei out of European networks stems
              from the decay of the world's trading system,
              and it may feed a spiralling sense of lawlessness.
            </li>
            <li>
              Such disengagement and containment cannot be applied across the
              entire economic relationship because of China's economic status.
              Instead a new trade regime is needed that acknowledges China's
              nature.
            </li>
            <li>
              The goal of the new architecture should be to maximize trade
              consistent with both sides' strategic security.
            </li>
            <li>
              Chinese firms should also be required to accept open governance
              of their big subsidiaries in the West.
            </li>
            <li>
              The West should act together to find a way to do business with an
              authoritarian state it mistrusts.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Free money</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The covid-19 pandemic has led to a supersized level
              of state intervention in the economy and financial markets,
              and as a result a profound shift in economics will take place.
            </li>
            <li>
              The four defining features of the new epoch:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Governments are borrowing at a jaw-dropping scale.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Central banks have created an enormous amount of reserves
                  to finance the government stimulus.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Fed and Treasury have waded into financial markets,
                  actively backstopping the private sector.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Low inflation means no immediate need to worry about public
                  debt.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The new era of economics reflects the culmination of long-term
              trends and may last for decades.
            </li>
            <li>
              A state with a permanently broader and deeper reach across economy
              creates some opportunities, but also presents grave risks.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sprawling macroeconomic management leads to infinite opportunities
              for politicians to play favorites, and further leads to distorted
              markets, moral hazard and low growth.
              Yet the single, simple tool of independent central banks --
              interest rates -- seems impotent today.
            </li>
            <li>
              Policymakers today needs to create a framework that allows the
              business cycle to be managed and financial crises to be fought
              without a politicized takeover of the economy.
            </li>
          </ul>
