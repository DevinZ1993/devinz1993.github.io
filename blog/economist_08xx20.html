          <h3><i>How to cope with middle age</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Google is in the midst of a mid-life crisis despite its glorious
              success on the surface today.
              This is what its founders would never embrace.
            </li>
            <li>
              The signs of ageing are apparent in Google's maturing business,
              its changing culture and its ever-more-entwined relationship with
              government.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Unearthing other gold mines has proved difficult.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The freewheeling ethos has become a liability.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The attention of trustbusters has long looked inevitable.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Should Google put its faith in managers, investors or geeks
              in response to the crisis?
              <ul>
                <li>
                  GE's woes offer a warning of the peril of relying on one
                  hugely successful division (GE Capital) to subsidize less
                  profitable units elsewhere.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Spinning off YouTube seems profitable, but the experiences of
                  firms like AT&amp;T and IBM highlight the danger that
                  downsizing hollows out innovation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Both Microsoft and Apple bounced back by rediscovering their
                  core purpose and applying it in a new way.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Indiscipline (as what Google does today) can lead to unexpected
              innovations, but more often saps vitality.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Trumpian TikTok</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Sino-American tech tensions now culminate in a forced sale
              of TikTok's American business to a domestic buyer.
            </li>
            <li>
              ByteDance is the latest in a series of Chinese firms to be targeted
              by the Trump administration amid fears of cyber-spying and
              propaganda-peddling, and will not be the last in the crosshairs.
            </li>
            <li>
              The data threat from China is real, but the expropriation detached
              from any rules or procedure undermines investor confidence in
              America and heaps political pressure on technocratic bodies like
              CFIUS.
            </li>
            <li>
              CFIUS probes need to conclude more promptly, and the committee's
              political independence also needs bolstering.
            </li>
            <li>
              A new federal data-privacy and cyber-security law would create
              transparent standards for handling America's data and stymie
              foreign hackers.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Xi's new economy</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Trump administration has assumed that China's steroidal state
              capitalism is weaker than it looks and thus pressing hard enough
              will lead to China's concessions and even collapse.
            </li>
            <li>
              China's economy has shown to be more resilient than expected and
              could propel growth for years.
            </li>
            <li>
              Underestimating China's economy is hardly a new phenomenon.
            </li>
            <li>
              Xi has started the next phase of Chinese state capitalism  to
              increase order and resilience against threats for good reasons.
            </li>
            <li>
              Xinomics has three elements:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Tight control over the economic and debt machine.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A more efficient administrative state, whose rules apply
                  uniformly across the economy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A blurred boundary between state and private firms.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Xinomics has performed well in the short term, but history
              suggests that diffuse decision-making, open borders and free
              speech are the magic ingredients for sustained innovation.
            </li>
            <li>
              The hope for confrontation followed by capitulation is misguided.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Silicon Valley v Wall Street</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A shift in the balance of power towards tech startups has caused a
              striking decline of IPOs in the past two decades.
            </li>
            <li>
              IPOs brokered by Wall Street banks tend to be gruelling and
              expensive ordeals for firms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Direct listing and blank-cheque are alternatives to IPOs,
              but they both have drawbacks.
            </li>
            <li>
              The IPO process needs improvement, but companies that take
              advantage of frothy stockmarkets will eventually get hammered.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
