          <h3><i>The business of survival</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The crisis is set to <i>amplify</i> three trends:
              <ul>
                <li>a quicker adoption of new technologies;</li>
                <li>an inevitable retreat from freewheeling global supply chains;</li>
                <li>a worrying rise in corporate concentration and cronyism.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Numerous indicators suggest extreme stress in commercial activity,
              even though many firms are putting a brave face on it.
            </li>
            <li>
              The pain will deepen as defaults cascade through domestic payment
              chains and global supply chains.
            </li>
            <li>
              Not all firms can survive the recession.
              Which will do depends on their industry, their balance-sheets and
              how easily they can tap government loans, guarantees and aid.
            </li>
            <li>
              In an intermediate phase after the lockdown, ingenuity will
              become a source of advantage, allowing clever firms to operate
              closer to full speed.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Cut to the chase</i></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Europe is repeating its history in 2010-12:
              talks over the covid-19 crisis has descended into another ugly row
              over which countries gain and lose from a common currency.
            </li>
            <li>
              Southern countries need government spending to avoid a deep and
              enduring slump, but that will sharply increase their debts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Northerners have long resisted mutualisation for fear of
              underwriting laxity in the south.
            </li>
            <li>
              The currency union cannot succeed unless its members share more
              risk.
              Failing to face this may sabotage the survival of the euro
              and perhaps the EU itself.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3><i>Wisconsin's warning</i></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Wisconsin, as a purple state that is bitterly fought over in
              national elections, has just provided a lesson how not to run
              an election.
            </li>
            <li>
              In any democracy, a party that considers pursuing a lower turnout
              to be a legitimate electoral strategy does not deserve to win
              elections.
            </li>
            <li>
              Partisanship, left unchecked, has shifted the struggle from policy
              to the hackery manipulation of the rules.
            </li>
            <li>
              States must not dither. Either make it easier to vote safely in
              person, or find secure ways to vote remotely.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3><i>5Geopolitics</i></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Two rival factions in the 1990s' American telecoms industry:
              <ul>
                <li>"bellheads" believe in proprietary technology, vertical
                  monopolies and deference to regulators;
                </li>
                <li>"netheads" favor open-source software, collaboration between
                  firms, and decentralized decision-making.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Earlier iterations of mobile technology all had their winners.
              Clearly, America does not want the winner of this time to be China.
            </li>
            <li>
              5G will not profoundly alter consumers' lives, but it enables
              networks that can support the "Internet of Things".
            </li>
            <li>
              The reason why Western security hawks fear Huawei is less that
              Huawei hoovers up data. Rather, in a conflict between China and
              the West, the firm could shut down an enemy's network and maybe
              even turn 10T devices into weapons.
            </li>
            <li>
              America's tough talk has had limited success and even backfired.
              <ul>
                <li>American tech companies found legal loopholes to keep selling
                  to Huawei.
                </li>
                <li>Only three allies complied with banishment against Huawei.</li>
                <li>It also prompted Huawei to wean itself off American
                  technology.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The open-architecture virtualized network launched by Rakuten
              suggests a nethead alternative.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3><i>Strategic pile-up</i></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The virus has reinforced an old idea: some industries are
              "strategic", simply too important for countries to leave to
              unfettered markets, and so deserving of special protection.
            </li>
            <li>
              In reality, no one can agree on which industries count as "strategic".
            </li>
            <li>Governments should resist indulging firms too liberally.
              <ul>
                <li>Sheltering them behind national-security arguments is,
                  like all protectionism, expensive.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It risks ushering in the baleful logic of the prisoner's
                  dilemma and leaving the world divided in the face of the next
                  crisis.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3><i>Stacked and whacked</i></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Startup founders are giving investors preferred stocks with
              liquidation preference in exchange for higher "post-money"
              valuations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Funds raised at lofty values can create misalignment later on
              between founders, early-stage vcs and late-stage investors.
            </li>
          </ul>
