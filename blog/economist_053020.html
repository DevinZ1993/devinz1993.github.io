          <h3><i>The American way</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The public believes Donald Trump's ineptitude has caused America's
              failure in responding to covid-19,
              but the numbers show that America has fared as well as Europe.
            </li>
            <li>
              The two features of the country's response to covid-19:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Covid-19, when it first hit, displayed an indifference to
                  presidents and their plans.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Other layers of government have adapted around the hole where
                  the president should have been.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Decentralized decision-making, compared with nationwide rules,
              is advantageously efficient in spotting and handling flare-ups.
            </li>
            <li>
              One way democracies can deal with the virus is to draw on reserves
              of people's trust.
            </li>
            <li>
              Without big bipartisan majorities,
              the economic response of the United States turns out to be better
              than Europe's.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mr Trump should not be absolved for undermining a co-ordinated
              international response and enraging half of the country's
              population.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>A â‚¬2trn loophole</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              European governments are adding up state aids to businesses,
              which are all but banned in normal times to ensure a level
              playing field for firms across the European Union.
            </li>
            <li>
              A temporary reprieve for governments is unavoidable,
              but it also carries long-term dangers, such as firms that please
              political masters.
            </li>
            <li>
              To not cripple the single market, bail-outs should be tolerated
              only when all other options have been exhausted.
            </li>
            <li>
              It should be ensured that companies are not using public cash to
              run large losses or to pay for their expansion plans once the
              economy opens up.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>The inflation bug</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In the long run, equities are a good hedge against inflation.
              But over shorter horizons, rising inflations is associated with
              falling stock prices, and vice versa.
            </li>
            <li>
              A finding shows that global equities have returned an average 5.2%
              a year above inflation since 1900.
            </li>
            <li>
               There are competing theories for the inverse relationship of
               stock prices and inflation.
               <ul>
                 <li>
                   Investors discount future earnings by reference to higher
                   nominal bond yields.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   Inflation reflects deeper forces that hurt stock prices.
                 </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Financial markets, for the most part, reflect the view that
              inflation will remain low, but many factors have caused the outlook
              murkier, such as the ebb of globalization, rise of populisms in
              rich countries, and increasing government debts.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>From BC to AD</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The workplace transformation caused by the pandemic is much more
              sudden than that occurred with factories in history.
            </li>
            <li>
              Technological and economic preconditions have enabled the rapid
              shift, but still some are missing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Offices will not disappear, but working life could not return to
              BC ways.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Workers don't have to commute through congested traffic,
                  and may even decide to live in small towns.
                </li>
                <li>
                  On the employer side, a large sum of money for maintaining
                  workplaces will be saved.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The barrier between home and working life will be even harder
                  to sustain, disrupting the rhythm of life.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
