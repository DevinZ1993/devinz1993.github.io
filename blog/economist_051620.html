          <h3><i>Goodbye globalisation</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Globalization has suffered from three body-blows:
              the 2018 financial crisis, the sino-American trade war,
              and the global pandemic of covid-19.
            </li>
            <li>
              With increasing international disputes, the underlying anarchy of
              global governance is being exposed.
            </li>
            <li>
              The international movement of people (travel and immigration),
              goods (trade) and capital (investment) is suffering.
            </li>
            <li>
              Domesticating supply chains will risk and forfeit economies of
              scale, and a fractured world will make solving global problems
              harder.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>On the blink</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The EU has muddled through since its early days,
              although the journey towards integration has been bumpy.
            </li>
            <li>
              The pandemic is becoming a political and constitutional crisis
              in Europe, for the EU's members cannot agree on what is needed to
              make their union more resilient, nor on how to bring about reform.
            </li>
            <li>
              Three bonds of membership are being tested:
              the single market, the single currency, and the status of EU law.
            </li>
            <li>
              The EU should be more aggressive, which means overcoming the taboo
              against treaty change, and adopting bigger transfers and significant
              debt mutualization.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Reopen and shut</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Never before have governments erected safety-nets as generous as
              those they have created during the pandemic.
            </li>
            <li>
              The emergency policies are indispensable,
              but maintaining them too long would be ruinously expensive and
              prevent labour markets from adapting to the new way of life that
              emerges from the pandemic.
            </li>
            <li>
              It seems increasingly likely that economies will be permanently
              changed, in terms of consumer habits, employee demands and
              industries' hiring preferences.
            </li>
            <li>
              The governments support would prevent the necessary adjustments
              from taking place, but withdrawing it too early would leave legions
              of unemployment workers fending for themselves in brutal conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              How to face the difficult balancing art?
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The most lavish support should be maintained only in industries
                  which the government is forcibly keeping closed.
                </li>
                <li>Schemes should encourage flexibility.</li>
                <li>Governments should help people find new jobs.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>The next garage</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Definitive layoff figures in tech's heartland are hard to come by,
              as many sackings at smaller startups are inevitably missed.
            </li>
            <li>
              VCs are scouting for promising firms whose valuations have dropped
              and which need fresh capital,
              while startups with cash in the coffers are seizing the
              opportunity to scoop up weaker rivals.
            </li>
            <li>
              Venture capital is flowing to offerings for business that are
              delivered virtually and targets that are deeply technical (Confluent).
            </li>
            <li>
              The crisis will accelerate the existing trend of exodus,
              which has been driven by exorbitant property prices, near-permanent
              traffic jams and the jarring number of homeless people.
            </li>
            <li>
              Another question is whether venture capital, Silicon Valley's
              lifeblood, will go virtual and distributed as well.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
