          <h3><i>The fire this time</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To America, the year 1968 was comparable to 2020 in terms of a
              deadly virus, a space mission, a protest sparked by racial
              injustice and a presidential election.
            </li>
            <li>
              The pessimism about police violence and racial inequality is
              unwarranted, and is also counter-productive.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The police system is made up of thousands of jurisdictions and
                  police departments, which are not all the same.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The sustained falls in crime over the past three decades
                  have made room for less warlike law enforcement.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Persistent riots and vandalism, as black leaders believe,
                  would wreck their political cause.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Fear could help Mr Trump win the election,
              but it betrays Mr Floyd's memory
              and undermines the unity of the nation.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Order above the law</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Reforming the fiendishly complex institution of American policing
              is much harder than recognizing the frustration.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Unlike policing in most European countries, American policing
                  is mostly local.
                </li>
                <li>
                  American police patrol a heavily armed country, which can
                  make their job dangerous.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Systemic racism does not mean that all officers are racists or
              bad people; it means that the system operates in a racially
              biased manner regardless of individual motivations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Military forces are designed to win wars, not trust, which
              makes their goal differ from that of the police.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Conduit's end</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Hong Kong's place in the world depends on having the rule of law,
              a trusted reputation and seamless access to Western financial
              markets.
            </li>
            <li>
              The trade war, a year of street protests and China's iron-fisted
              response to them raise new questions about Hong Kong's durability,
              although there's no sign of capital flight so far.
            </li>
            <li>
              The prudent policy for China is to try to speed up the development
              of the mainland's financial capabilities so that it is less exposed
              to potential American punishment, but that will be hard to
              accomplish and will take a long time.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Orbital liberties</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The feat of the Crew Dragon is good news for astronauts, for
              American taxpayers and for the world at large.
            </li>
            <li>
              SpaceX's success is not a matter of outcompeting NASA so much
              as a matter of NASA learning how to do things better.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Crew Dragon is available not only to NASA, but to anyone who
              can pay, such as those intrepid wealthy souls.
            </li>
            <li>
              More programmes of NASA should and will be run in such commercially
              focused way, thereby producing an infrastructure available to
              the private sector.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><i>Return of the paranoid style</i></h3>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The infodemic around covid-19 is not the world's first outbreak of
              misinformation, but the rapid worldwide transmission enabled by
              the Internet is unprecedented.
            </li>
            <li>
              Today's infodemic appears to be spreading more easily among the
              world's conservatives than its liberals.
            </li>
            <li>
              Conservatives also seem more likely than liberals to question the
              mainstream sources of information.
            </li>
            <li>
              Conspiracy beliefs are associated with ideological extremism of
              any variety.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Most recently, social networks' algorithms have steered people
                  towards polarizing content.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In some countries, the electoral system gives conservative
                  politicians a particular incentive to encourage polarization.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
